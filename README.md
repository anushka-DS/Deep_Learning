# Deep_Learning

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.

In other words, It mirrors the functioning of our brains. Deep learning algorithms are similar to how nervous system structured where each neuron connected each other and passing information. Andrew NG described the idea of deep learning as:

Using brain simulations, hope to:

– Make learning algorithms much better and easier to use.

– Make revolutionary advances in machine learning and AI.

I believe this is our best shot at progress towards real AI
